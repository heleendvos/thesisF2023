      "Original Text (0): You can \"buy\" the show and stream it through them. Including the [Lethal Weapon 6](url episode, which I assume is the one he's talking about. EDIT: Sorry, I forgot there were two Lethal Weapon episodes. The one with \"Lethal Weapon 5\" got pulled. [Season 6, Episode 9](url is not available for purchase. TBH when I was younger this sort of thing bugged me, but I also responded to it in the least constructive way. I thought it was fun to act more creepy when I noticed that sort of thing was happening, just to push that person's buttons. Now I just keep doing things like I normally would. I'm not going to lose sleep over some stranger's opinions of me. We have a slackbot form that we fill out every Tuesday, which is basically a waste. \"what are you working on?\" \"BUG-123\". \"What do you hope to accomplish this week?\" \"BUG-123 and BUG-456\". \"Any blockers?\" \"No\". Same thing every time except different ticket numbers (usually). On Fridays we do a zoom meeting where we go over every ticket for the sprint and talk about its status. That tends to be more productive. I usually tell them. I had it sort of bite me in one interview though. It was like 2016 and the interviewers didn't even know Glassdoor was a thing, somehow. I checked before the interview to see what to expect, then they ended up asking me the exact same questions. I was honest, like \"yeah, I've seen all these\", then talked about my interview prep process and assured them I wasn't just rote memorizing answers to their questions, but that practice-interviewing myself with the questions on Glassdoor was the most effective way to prepare for the assumption that they'd ask similar but different questions. I could tell they were torn between thinking I had cheated but knowing I wouldn't be so bluntly honest about it if I had. Like seriously guys, your last several hires have used this to study, then posted themselves after they were hired... how are y'all not aware of this? They ended up bringing me in for the next round of interviews (which was mostly behavioral stuff that you can't really post). I thought I did well on that round, but they ghosted me until the recruiter finally sent a rejection letter 3 months later. Lol, bullet dodged I guess. My school had uinforms which allowed boys and girls to wear shorts during warmer months, but also had rules that prevented girls' shorts from being too short and boys' shorts from being too long. Nobody wore them because the rules (and general design of the uniform) just made them look bad on everybody. Finally one particularly hot spring a bunch of the dudes in my class got together and decided to go ahead and wear the \"mailman shorts\" and it wouldn't be uncool if we were all doing it. An aircraft carrier with shark teeth?! Hell yes! I wasn’t a huge fan of that feature in XCOM, but I think it plays a lot better in Midnight Suns for sure. Feels real natural with the rest of the game. Granted, this guy broke that one too. Outcome probably depends how bureaucratic and vindictive your company is. Start the meeting by complimenting the security team on doing such a good job of identifying potential malicious issues so quickly. It's likely they're just working their way down a checklist of how to respond, and that checklist was written for people who did this accidentally and will naively say things like \"I didn't do anything wrong. I just picked up this USB stick in the parking lot and inserted it in my computer. What's wrong with that?\". So just try your best to let them do their job without making a fuss about it. Apologize and promise not to do it again. This is an easier technical problem to solve than the transition to digital TV broadcasts, but is somehow running into even more delays. Which states aren't automatically issuing REAL ID compliant licenses at this point? This is crazy. Hmm, AI not ready to pass the touring test until it can generate 30 minutes of Joe speculating what the world will be like once neuralink is commercially available and kids' shows won't have to teach the kids lessons because they'll just already know the lessons. And also they'll be able to sense each other's thoughts so won't need lessons because they'll all be on the same page. Hey Jamie, pull up that video of the monkey typing with his brain. ok, this one came out pretty convincing: &gt;Prompt: \"Generate a transcript of a Joe Rogan Experience episode where he asks Donald Trump about his experiences using DMT\" &amp;#x200B; &gt;The Joe Rogan Experience is a popular podcast hosted by comedian and mixed martial arts commentator Joe Rogan. In this fictional episode, Rogan interviews Donald Trump, the former President of the United States, and asks him about his experiences using the psychedelic drug DMT. &gt; &gt;Rogan: Hey everyone, welcome to the Joe Rogan Experience. Today I have a very special guest, the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump. &gt; &gt;Trump: Thank you, Joe. It's great to be here. &gt; &gt;Rogan: Mr. President, I have to ask you, have you ever tried DMT? &gt; &gt;Trump: (laughs) No, Joe, I have not. &gt; &gt;Rogan: Really? Because I heard that you were a big fan of psychedelics back in the day. &gt; &gt;Trump: Well, I won't deny that I experimented with some drugs in my younger days. But DMT was never something that I tried. &gt; &gt;Rogan: I see. Well, I have to say, I find DMT to be one of the most fascinating substances on the planet. It's a naturally occurring psychedelic that's been used for centuries by indigenous people in South America. It's known for causing intense and profound experiences. &gt; &gt;Trump: I'm not really interested in that kind of thing, Joe. I'm more focused on making America great again. &gt; &gt;Rogan: Well, I have to say, I think it's interesting that you never tried DMT. I mean, it's a substance that has the potential to completely change your perspective on reality. &gt; &gt;Trump: (laughs) I don't think I need any help with that, Joe. My perspective on reality is just fine. &gt; &gt;Rogan: (laughs) Fair enough, Mr. President. Well, thank you for coming on the show and talking to us. &gt; &gt;Trump: Thank you, Joe. It's been a pleasure. &gt; &gt;The episode ends with Joe thanking Donald Trump for his time and the conversation coming to a close. There's already a Battletoads movie out, but they messed up with a marketing deal and it's only sold on bluray exclusively at Gamestop brick and mortar locations. Call your local store and ask them if they have any copies. The good thing about being late is you don’t have to be the one to figure out whether we’re doing recycling this week or not. “Again” well, there’s your problem Madness?!? This is SAN SALVADOR!!!!! ChatGPT scared me today by passing all my job interview questions. I was even able to coach it to a correct answer on a question it originally got wrong (and where I had inadvertently created a trick question). Basically: Me: rewrite this recursive function to make it iterative: function f(x){ if (x &lt;= 0){ return 0; } return f(x-1); } GPT: (a correct iterative form of this) Me: Write some unit tests for it GPT: ok. check f(-1) == 0, check f(0) == 0, check f(1) == 1, f(2) == 1, f(3) == 1 Me: I don't think those last 3 tests are going to pass. GPT: \"Of course, because this function always returns 0.\" (rewrites the unit tests, correctly expecting every case to return 0). I was too afraid to ask it to rewrite the function for efficiency, but I'm really impressed that it correctly deduced that the function always returns 0, which was just a dumb bug on my part for writing an incomplete question. &gt; Let me send Charlie out to collect reagents. That is genius I’d like it if the “change outfits every day” option could limit to a subset of outfits. I’ve unlocked a lot of options that I don’t like. I love how “no I’m trying to be different than mom” and “I don’t like labels” are some of the most goth things a person could say. Can’t not be goth in this game. What news sources would they pull, and what does the law cover? Like would this just apply to big names like CNN , Fox News, etc? What about smaller niche media outlets like Media Matters or Breitbart? Random blogs from crazy people? Might be a win/win if they pull all of those, but if the mainstream content gets pulled and only fringe stuff is left, might be a different story. Wishing to be involved in the sales process is a serious monkey’s paw. Makes\n",

      "Original Text (1): me want to play Q*bert Holy shit, based Alex Jones? Broken clocks I guess. Normally I see a t-shirt, I downvote and report spam. I don’t see any attempts to sell this one though. On the other hand, if this is genuine, OP needs to keep the watch running. They ain’t gonna pause the clock for you if you collapse during a race, so keep it running during your training run too. Earn that DNF. Full article is paywalled, but this looks like the bank is just blowing smoke up some activist’s ass and not intending to actually do any tracking. If they actually try to implement it they’ll get plenty of false positives, but people will just buy their guns with cash. Those questions are only useful if you ask the candidate to talk you through their solution. You can tell pretty quickly if they didn't write the code themselves. I'd like to do it in a controlled environment though. i.e. our current interview process involves an online coding test, then a zoom call to go over the solutions. We could theoretically run into problems where a candidate submits GPT-generated answers, then reads over them before the interview. But I guess if they can correctly explain why GPT made the decisions it did, that's still better than a lot of people we've been interviewing lately... there's at least some chance that person would have been able to write the code on their own as well. &gt; most of them don't realize what HR is doing in the behavioral interview (which is about sniffing out bullshitters) You're overestimating a lot of HR people. Surely the battery life would make that a lot less practical You're correct on how it works. AirTag connects with some rando's phone, then rando's phone reports GPS info to Apple. Apple then reports that GPS info to the person who owns the AirTag. So you wouldn't be able to track who went to a random place, because Apple won't give you that info. They'll tell you *somebody* was near your wallet, but won't specify who. Not really. I’m oversimplifying a bit, but the AirTag just constantly broadcasts a signal like, “Hi I’m an airtag and my ID is 14234123”. If a phone is close enough to receive that signal, it does the courtesy of letting Apple know it saw that tag. . I'm sure they're assuming it won't affect the number of subscribers. The kind of people so addicted to Twitter that they're willing to pay $8/month for it will either pay $8 via the web to save money, or pay $11 via Apple to be lazy. They're probably regularly using Twitter via both platforms anyhow, so they're not going to have to go too far out of their way to sign up via the web. A company willing to wait that long must be pretty desperate to hire. On the one hand they might have offered a lot of money. On the other hand, there might be a reason they weren't able to fill the position with somebody more proactive. Taking the other job was very probably the right call lol. &gt; not being able to just casually mention that you got your COVID booster or your flu shot at the office strikes me as really weird. The headline just says the word \"vaccines\", but the article specifies that \"the effectiveness of vaccines\" is an off-limits topic, which seems to be targeting something different than what you're talking about. Like \"BRB, I have to go to Walgreens and get my flu shot\" doesn't have anything to do with effectiveness. At a stretch, \"I got my covid vaccine yesterday and today I have a massive headache so I'm going to take the day off\" might, but clearly this is really about people getting sidetracked to argue about the political ends of that discussion. The worst thing in the world is when you have to fill out a complaint form and the text box has some ridiculous 250 character limit, but I guess in this case I'll allow it. That sounds like a reasonable rule to me, if applied reasonably. If you're going to ship the code without changing the thing, then it's better to have a ticket than to not have one. If you let the code go as-is but don't have the ticket you're still accruing tech debt, just making it infinitely less likely that you'll ever fix it. It sounds like you're probably running into some disagreements over what is or isn't essential, and what should or shouldn't hold up the PR. You're going to have to fight each of those battles individually and probably become more lenient in what you're willing to let slip. Didn't he frame Krusty for armed robbery, not shoplifting? Is there any data on how many people only had the one federal felony charge on their record? Isn't this the kind of thing they usually only tacked on top of other charges? That's basically how I've always done it. Still demand 100% coverage, but if that coverage comes from an integration test instead of a unit test, that's fine. 4 way split turned out great in 1860. Meeting on one monitor, reddit on the other. Find a less-meeting-heavy job though. They're out there, even at the tech lead level. I have like 3 hours of meetings a week tops. I suppose the best \"get rich quick\" scheme that wouldn't be illegal would be if he found a way to mine cryptocurrency more efficiently than other technology on the market. If he was the only one using it, he should be able to generate enough money to make a tidy profit (depending how much more efficient his solution was), but that's basically the equivalent of printing money. Done at too large a scale, it'll cause inflation and tank the value of currency. It's a shame we probably won't get to see The Rock in the MCU. The thing is they included all the t-shirt spam bots in that calculation. Anybody who got a single upvote is probably in the top 1% The question was specifically about *violent* people who refuse assistance. The city has a duty to protect its citizens from people like that. In cases where violence can be remedied by getting the person assistance, that's great. But if the person refuses assistance and is still violent, there's still a problem to solve and the city can't just throw up their hands and say there's nothing to do about the problem. I really hope saying they’re “pretty much” over is just a turn of phrase and she’s not really considering any chance of staying with the guy. Of course that's what they *should* do, but it seems the MO lately has been for the police to just shrug it off and say they can't do anything. Like that thread from the other day where some unstable homeless person was throwing rocks at people's houses and the police did nothing until the security camera video went viral and embarrassed them. &gt; a reclining office chair at my kitchen table instead of a hard/flat chair You’re a genius! (I just don’t have a kitchen table. We eat on the couch and coffee table) Let’s hope we never have to brainwash anyone in China with those. It’s important for them to *believe* in him (and thus, believe in the festive spirit of Christmas, etc), not to factually know that he exists. Sorry, best I can offer is “the uniform bureau is actually a front for Section 31” The way the interviewer raises her eyebrows when she hears about the 72 genders. Kind of a niche thing, but I worked for a company that made backend software for voicemail services at big cell phone carriers. There was an attempt to make \"celebrity greetings\" a thing for a while and have an online store where people could pay a few bucks to use a celebrity-recorded voicemail greeting. So like \"Hi, this is Carly Rae Jepsen and [user saying their own name in their own voice] can't come to the phone right now. Leave a message and [he/she]'ll call you maybe!\" Watch the video on one monitor, have IDE open in another. If anybody else looks towards your desk, page between files, scroll up and down, type something, then let out a loud sigh and delete what you just typed. \"dang, that's not going to work after all\" &gt; waiting for QA to give me some data for a unit test Seems like your company might be in the habit of doing unit tests wrong. You should have everything you need to unit test your own work. But, if you need to wait for input, start working on your next task and get better at switching back and forth. Proper unit tests should run against a clean local DB and create whatever test data they need, then remove that data after the test has run.\n",
